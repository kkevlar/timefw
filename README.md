#Time FW

Tests runtime of the fw program with different compilation paramaters.

## Cloning 

Fw is a private repository so a full clone will only work with authorized keys.  With authorization, use recursive cloning.

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kkevlar/timefw
```

To update the submodules use:

```shell
git submodule update --remote
```
